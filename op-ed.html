				<h5>ADVOCACY MATERIAL</h5>
				<h5>Op-Ed: Menstrual Leave for Women</h5>
				<h5>How does it play out in our fight for equality?</h5>
				<p>For most women, getting their monthly periods prompts a standard procedure: Pop in that painkiller, ignore the heavy flow, preferably avoid strangling others and keep moving on with their daily lives and jobs.</p>
				<p>However, there are some women who genuinely need to take a day or two off. It could be due to severe cramps, endometriosis or dysmenorrhea. These sound incredibly painful – and they are. In this case, following Japan, China and South Korea’s lead, implementing a menstrual leave policy in our country could certainly help. This will enable women to take two days off from work every month at the beginning of their menstrual cycle.</p>
				<p>Interestingly, the Ningxia region in Northern China implemented this leave under a different circumstance. Ningxia announced this policy on the 17th August, 2016 – just days after China's Olympic swimmer Fu Yuanhui discussed her fourth place loss in the Rio Olympics, suggesting that her physical exhaustion due to menstruation slowed down her strokes. This sparked conversations by Chinese women about how their cycle slowed down their productivity in the workplace. The Ningxia government then consciously included a clause on punishment for employers who did not follow the new guidelines.</p>
				<p>India too came very close to the implementation of this policy last year, but unfortunately, this Private Member Bill was not passed in the Parliament.</p>
				<p>When the term ‘Menstrual Leave’ was first mentioned, most women would have presumably thought something along the same lines - “Now there’s something that will enrage and provide more ammunition to the so-called ‘men’s rights activists’”.</p>
				<p>It was a very legitimate thought for anyone to have. As a country, we are still battling for the most basic forms of gender equality in almost every aspect of modern life – at the workplace, in relationships and personal lives, etc. Can we then promote any form preferential treatment for women that might endanger the march towards equality?</p>
				<p>For the menstrual leave policy may raise questions about the reinforcement of the age-old conservative belief that women are addled creatures who need special care, bringing with it other regressive beliefs and attitudes. It is therefore important to educate ourselves on how physically inconvenient, if not painful, a period can be for the average woman.</p>
				<p>To put it in the simplest of terms, a period is a biological process where the womb sheds the inner uterine wall in the absence of a pregnancy, and this is expelled from the body in the form of a heavy blood flow. It sounds quite straightforward when described in medical terms. But to go through it every single month for at least 40 years of one’s life is not that easy.</p>
				<p>It understandably takes a mental and a physical toll on any woman who works long hours every day, and if this is combined with a debilitating condition like dysmenorrhea (which has a 40-70% occurrence in Indian women), it might be extremely hard for many women to just get out of bed, let alone be productive at work. In this case, having a menstrual leave policy at the workplace is completely justified – it can reduce the toll of the physical pain on women.</p>
				<p>While implementing such a policy will definitely help a woman’s work productivity and therefore the productivity of the companies in the long run, it may also place some burdens on the private sector. In order to incentivise companies to follow the law, the government can provide tax exemptions or compensate the company for the menstrual leaves availed by its women employees so that the burden of compliance is reduced.</p>
				<p>“But how can you call yourself a feminist by saying that you want equality, yet demand special treatment for women?”</p>
				<p>A policy like menstrual leave does indicate the bearings of differential treatment, and but in no way does it demean the women’s empowerment movement.</p>
				<p>It does not classify as preferential treatment or entitlement if it provides relief from a painful physical process which a whole gender has to suffer through for a large portion of their lives. But if menstrual leave could be implemented, it would go on to greatly lessen a woman’s stress during her period cycle, thus giving her the option of staying home and working on her own terms, as opposed to making frequent trips to the washroom to change her sanitary pad, or popping in painkillers just to get through the next few hours.</p>
				<p>While such a policy could polarise male counterparts in the workplace - but this could be combated through the acknowledgement of stigma surrounding the issue. The stigma surrounding menstrual periods has been so thoroughly internalised that it becomes awkward to discuss the pain or discomfort that women face. Period pain can no longer be a topic of taboo, especially when it concerns women as a whole. It is a topic that must be normalised and spoken up about, so as to raise awareness. A woman’s menstrual issues is something that only she can make decisions on, not a third-person who decides to trivialise her pain by saying that ‘it is not that big a deal’.</p>
